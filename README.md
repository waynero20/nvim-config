Welcome to my **Neovim configuration**, crafted for speed, aesthetics, and a modern development experience. This setup is written entirely in **Lua**, powered by **lazy.nvim** for plugin management, and includes custom enhancements for TypeScript, Dart, Rust, and more.

🚀 Plugin Management with `lazy.nvim`

This config uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), a performance-focused plugin manager that offers:

- Lazy-loading for fast startup
- Clean dependency management
- Modular plugin architecture

See `lua/lazy_setup.lua` for how it's initialized.
